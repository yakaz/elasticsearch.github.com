    id: analysis
    text: >
        Analysis is the process of converting "full text":#text to "terms":#term.
        Depending on which analyzer is used, these phrases: "@FOO BAR@",
        "@Foo-Bar@", "@foo,bar@" will probably all result in the terms "@foo@"
        and "@bar@".  These terms are what is actually stored in the index.


        A full text query (not a "term":#term query) for "@FoO:bAR@" will
        also be analyzed to the terms "@foo@","@bar@" and will thus match
        the terms stored in the index.


        It is this process of analysis (both at index time and at search time)
        that allows elasticsearch to perform full text queries.


        Also see "text":#text and "term":#term.
-
    id: cluster
    text: >
        A cluster consists of one or more "nodes":#node which share the same
        cluster name. Each cluster has a single master node which is
        chosen automatically by the cluster and which can be replaced if
        the current master node fails.

-
    id: document
    text: >
        A document is a JSON document which is stored in elasticsearch. It is
        like a row in a table in a relational database. Each document is
        stored in an "index":#index and has a "type":#type
        and an "id":#id.


        A document is a JSON object (also known in other languages
        as a hash / hashmap / associative array) which contains zero or more
        "fields":#field, or key-value pairs.


        The original JSON document that is indexed will be stored in the
        "@_source@ field":#source_field, which is returned by default
        when getting or searching for a document.

-
    id: id
    text: >
        The ID of a "document":#document identifies a document. The
        @index/type/id@ of a document must be unique. If no ID is provided,
        then it will be auto-generated. (also see "routing":#routing)

-
    id: field
    text: >
        A "document":#document contains a list of fields,  or key-value pairs.
        The value can be a simple (scalar) value (eg a string, integer, date),
        or a nested structure like an array or an object. A field is similar
        to a column in a table in a relational database.


        The "mapping":#mapping for each field has a field 'type'
        (not to be confused with document "type":#type) which indicates the
        type of data that can be stored in that field, eg
        @integer@, @string@, @object@.
        The mapping also allows you to define (amongst other things) how the
        value for a field should be analyzed.

-
    id: index
    text: >
        An index is like a 'database' in a relational database. It has a
        "mapping":#mapping which defines multiple
        "types":#type.


        An index is a logical namespace which maps to one or more
        "primary shards":#primary_shard and can have zero or more
        "replica shards":#replica.

-
    id: mapping
    text: >
        A mapping is like a 'schema definition' in a relational database.
        Each "index":#index has a mapping, which defines each
        "type":#type within the index, plus a number of
        index-wide settings.


        A mapping can either be defined explicitly, or it will be generated
        automatically when a document is indexed.
-
    id: node
    text: >
        A node is a running instance of elasticsearch which belongs to a
        "cluster":#cluster. Multiple nodes can be started on a single
        server for testing purposes, but usually you should have one node
        per server.


        At startup, a node will use unicast (or multicast, if specified)
        to discover an existing cluster with the same cluster name and will
        try to join that cluster.

-
    id: primary shard
    text: >
        Each document is stored in a single primary "shard":#shard. When you
        index a document, it is indexed first on the primary shard, then
        on all "replicas":#replica_shard of the primary shard.


        By default, an "index":#index has 5 primary shards.  You can specify fewer
        or more primary shards to scale the number of "documents":#document
        that your index can handle.


        You cannot change the number of primary shards in an index, once the
        index is created.


        See also "routing":#routing

-
    id: replica shard
    text: >
        Each "primary shard":#primary_shard can have zero or more replicas.
        A replica is a copy of the primary shard, and has two purposes:

        # increase failover: a replica shard can be promoted
        to a primary shard if the primary fails

        # increase performance: get and search requests can be handled by
        primary or replica shards.



        By default, each primary shard has one replica, but the number
        of replicas can be changed dynamically on an existing index.
        A replica shard will never be started on the same node as its primary
        shard.

-
    id: routing
    text: >
        When you index a document, it is stored on a single
        "primary shard":#primary_shard. That shard is chosen by hashing
        the @routing@ value.  By default, the @routing@ value is derived
        from the ID of the document or, if the document has a specified
        parent document, from the ID of the parent document (to ensure
        that child and parent documents are stored on the same shard).


        This value can be overridden by specifying a @routing@ value at index
        time, or a "routing field":/guide/reference/mapping/routing-field.html
        in the "mapping":#mapping.

-
    id: shard
    text: >
        A shard is a single Lucene instance. It is a low-level "worker" unit
        which is managed automatically by elasticsearch.  An index
        is a logical namespace which points to "primary":#primary_shard
        and "replica":#replica_shard shards.


        Other than defining the number of primary and replica shards that
        an index should have, you never need to refer to shards directly.
        Instead, your code should deal only with an index.


        Elasticsearch distributes shards amongst all "nodes":#node in
        the "cluster":#cluster, and can move shards automatically from
        one node to another in the case of node failure, or the addition
        of new nodes.

-
    id: source field
    text: >
        By default, the JSON document that you index will be stored in the
        @_source@ field and will be returned by all get and search requests.
        This allows you access to the original object directly from search
        results, rather than requiring a second step to retrieve the object
        from an ID.


        Note: the exact JSON string that you indexed will be returned to you,
        even if it contains invalid JSON.  The contents of this field do not
        indicate anything about how the data in the object has been indexed.
-
    id: term
    text: >
        A term is an exact value that is indexed in elasticsearch. The terms
        @foo@, @Foo@, @FOO@ are NOT equivalent. Terms (ie exact values) can
        be searched for using 'term' queries.

        See also "text":#text and "analysis":#analysis.
-
    id: text
    text: >
        Text (or full text) is ordinary unstructured text, such as this
        paragraph. By default, text will be "analyzed":analysis into
        "terms":#term, which is what is actually stored in the index.


        Text "fields":#field need to be analyzed at index time in order to
        be searchable as full text, and keywords in full text queries must
        be analyzed at search time to produce (and search for) the same
        terms that were generated at index time.


        See also "term":#term and "analysis":#analysis.
-
    id: type
    text: >
        A type is like a 'table' in a relational database. Each type has
        a list of "fields":#field that can be specified for
        "documents":#document of that type. The
        "mapping":#mapping defines how each field in the document
        is analyzed.
