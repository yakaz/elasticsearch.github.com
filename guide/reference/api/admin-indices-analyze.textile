p. Performs the analysis process on a text and return the tokens breakdown of the text. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/test/_analyze?text=this+is+a+test'
</pre>

p. The above will run an analysis on the "this is a test" text, using the default index analyzer associated with the @test@ index. An @analyzer@ can also be provided to use a different analyzer:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/test/_analyze?analyzer=whitespace' -d 'this is a test'
</pre>

p. Also, the analyzer can be derived based on a field mapping, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/test/_analyze?field=obj1.field1' -d 'this is a test'
</pre>

p. Will cause the analysis to happen based on the analyzer configure in the mapping for @obj1.field1@ (and if not, the default index analyzer).


p. Also, the text can be provided as part of the request body, and not as a parameter.

h2. Format

p. By default, the format the tokens are returned in are in json and its called @detailed@. The @text@ format value provides the analyzed data in a text stream that is a bit more readable.
