p. The delete index API allows to delete an existing index.

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/'
</pre>

p. The above example deletes an index called @twitter@.

p. The delete index API can also be applied to more than one index, or on @_all@ indices (be careful!). All indices will also be deleted when no specific index is provided. In order to disable allowing to delete all indices, set @action.disable_delete_all_indices@ setting in the config to @true@.
