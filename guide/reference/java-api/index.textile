p. This section describes the Java API that elasticsearch provides. All elasticsearch operations are executed using a "Client":/guide/reference/java-api/client.html object. All operations are completely asynchronous in nature (either accepts a listener, or return a future).

p. Additionally, operations on a client may be accumulated and executed in "Bulk":/guide/reference/java-api/bulk.html.

p. Note, all the "APIs":/guide/reference/api are exposed through the Java API (actually, the Java API is used internally to execute them).

h2. Maven Repository

p. Elasticsearch is hosted on "Maven Central":http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22elasticsearch%22.

p. For example, you can define the latest version in your @pom.xml@ file:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-xml">
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
    <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
    <version>{{site.categories.download[0].version}}</version>
</dependency>
</pre>
