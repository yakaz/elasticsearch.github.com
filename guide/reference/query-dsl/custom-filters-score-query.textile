p. A @custom_filters_score@ query allows to execute a query, and if the hit matches a provided filter (ordered), use either a boost or a script associated with it to compute the score. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "custom_filters_score" : {
        "query" : {
            "match_all" : {}
        },
        "filters" : [
            {
                "filter" : { "range" : { "age" : {"from" : 0, "to" : 10} } },
                "boost" : "3"
            },
            {
                "filter" : { "range" : { "age" : {"from" : 10, "to" : 20} } },
                "boost" : "2"
            }
        ]
    }
}
</pre>

p. This can considerably simplify and increase performance for parameterized based scoring since filters are easily cached for faster performance, and boosting / script is considerably simpler.

h2. Score Mode

p. A @score_mode@ can be defined to control how multiple matching filters control the score. By default, it is set to @first@ which means the first matching filter will control the score of the result. It can also be set to @max@/@total@/@avg@ which will aggregate the result from all matching filters based on the aggregation type.

h2. Script

p. A @script@ can be used instead of @boost@ for more complex score calculations. With optional @params@ and @lang@ (on the same level as @query@ and @filters@).
