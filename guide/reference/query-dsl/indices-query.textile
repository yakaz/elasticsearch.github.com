p. The @indices@ query can be used when executed across multiple indices, allowing to have a query that executes only when executed on an index that matches a specific list of indices, and another query that executes when it is executed on an index that does not match the listed indices.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "indices" : {
        "indices" : ["index1", "index2"],
        "query" : {
            "term" : { "tag" : "wow" }
        },
        "no_match_query" : {
            "term" : { "tag" : "kow" }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. @no_match_query@ can also have "string" value of @none@ (to match no documents), and @all@ (to match all).
