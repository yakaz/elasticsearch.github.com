p. Filters documents that only have the provided ids. Note, this filter does not require the @_id@ field to be indexed since it works using the @_uid@ field.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "ids" : {
        "type" : "my_type"
        "values" : ["1", "4", "100"]
    }
}    
</pre>

p. The @type@ is optional and can be omitted, and can also accept an array of values.
