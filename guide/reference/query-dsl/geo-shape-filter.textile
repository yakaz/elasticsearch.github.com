p. Efficient filtering of documents containing shapes indexed using the @geo_shape@ type.  

p. Much like the @geo_shape@ type, the @geo_shape@ Filter uses a grid square representation of the filter shape to find those documents which have shapes that relate to the filter shape in a specified way.  In order to do this, the field being filtered *must* be of @geo_shape@ type.  The Filter will use the same PrefixTree configuration as defined for the field.

h1. Filter Format

p.  The Filter supports two way of defining the Filter shape, either by providing a whole shape defintion, or by referencing the name of a shape pre-indexed in another index.  Both formats are defined below with examples.  

p. In addition to the shape, the @relation@ type must be defined, which sets how the filter shape and indexed shapes must relate.  The following @relation@ types are currently supported:

* @intersects@ - Finds those indexed shapes which intersect with the filter shape.  Intersection occurs when the two shapes have at least one shared grid hash.  Because of current limitations of the algorithm, very large indexed shapes are not deemed to intersect with very small filter shapes.  However, smaller index shapes will intersect with larger filter shapes.
* @disjoint@ - Finds those indexed shapes which do not intersect with the filter shape.  This means the two shapes will not share any grid hashes.
* @contains@ - Finds those indexed shapes which are fully contained within the filter shape.  Unlike @intersects@, this means the all of the indexed shape must be present inside the filter shape.  Any shapes will additional area outside of the filter shape are excluded.  This relationship is still experimental.

h2. Provided Shape Definition

Again, like the @geo_shape@ type, the @geo_shape@ Filter uses "GeoJSON":http://www.geojson.org to represent shapes.  The following is an example of using the Filter with a provided Shape definition which also makes use of ElasticSearch's @envelope@ GeoJSON extension:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "match_all" : {}
        },
        "filter" : {
            "geo_shape" : {
                "location" : {
		    "shape" : {
		        "type" : "envelope",
			"coordinates" : [[-45.0, 45.0], [45.0, -45.0]]
		    }
		    "relation" : "contains"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Pre-Indexed Shape

The Filter also supports using a shape which has already been indexed in another index and/or index type.  This is particularly useful for when you have a pre-defined list of shapes which are useful to your application and you want to reference this using a logical name (for example 'New Zealand') rather than having to provide their coordinates each time.  In this situation it is only necessary to provide:

* @id@ - The ID of the document that containing the pre-indexed shape.
* @index@ - Name of the index where the pre-indexed shape is.  Defaults to 'shapes'.
* @type@ - Index type where the pre-indexed shape is.
* @shape_field_name@ - Name of the field in the document containing the pre-indexed shape.  Defaults to 'shape'.

p. The following is an example of using the Filter with a pre-indexed shape:

<pre class="prettyprint	lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
    "query" : {
            "match_all" : {}
	    },
        "filter" : {
            "geo_shape" : {
	    	"location" : {
		    "indexed_shape" : {
		        "id" : "New Zealand",
			"type" : "countries",
			"index" : "shapes"
			"shape_field_name" : "shape"
		    }
                    "relation" : "contains"
		}
            }
	}
    }
}
</pre>

h1. Caching

p. The result of the Filter is not cached by default.  Setting @_cache@ to @true@ will mean the results of the Filter will be cached.  Since shapes can contain 10s-100s of coordinates and any one differing means a new shape, it may make sense to only using caching when you are sure that the shapes will remain reasonably static.
