p. Each document indexed is associated with an id and a type. The @_id@ field can be used to index just the id, and possible also store it. By default it is not indexed and not stored (thus, not created).

p. Note, even though the @_id@ is not indexed, all the APIs still work (since they work with the @_uid@ field), as well as fetching by ids using the @ids@ query/filter.

p. The @_id@ field can be enabled to be indexed, and possibly stored, using:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" : {
        "_id" : {"index": "not_analyzed", "store" : "yes"}
    }
}
</pre>

p. In order to maintain backward compatibility, a node level setting @index.mapping._id.indexed@ can be set to @true@ to make sure that the id is indexed when upgrading to @0.16@, though its recommended to not index the id.

p. The @_id@ mapping can also be associated with a @path@ that will be used to extract the id from a different location in the source document. For example, having the following mapping:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "tweet" : {
        "_id" : {
            "path" : "post_id"
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. Will cause @1@ to be used as the id for:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "message" : "You know, for Search",
    "post_id" : "1"
}
</pre>

This does require an additional lightweight parsing step while indexing, in order to extract the id in order to decide which shard the index operation will be executed on.
