p. Mapper type called @geo_point@ to support geo based points. The declaration looks as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "properties" : {
            "location" : {
                "type" : "geo_point"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h1. Input Structure

The above mapping defines a @geo_point@, which accepts different formats. The following formats are supported:

h2. Lat Lon as Properties

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : {
            "lat" : 41.12,
            "lon" : -71.34
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Lat Lon as String

p. Format in @lat,lon@.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : "41.12,-71.34"
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Geohash

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : "drm3btev3e86"
    }
}
</pre>

h2. Lat Lon as Array

p. Format in @[lon, lat]@, note, the order of lon/lat here in order to conform with "GeoJSON":http://geojson.org/.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "pin" : {
        "location" : [-71.34, 41.12]
    }
}
</pre>


h1. Indexed Fields

p. The @geo_point@ mapping will index a single field with the format of @lat,lon@. The @lat_lon@ option can be set to also index the @.lat@ and @.lon@ as numeric fields, and @geohash@ can be set to @true@ to also index @.geohash@ value. Note, those values are almost never needed to be indexed unless explicit queries against those fields are needed. All the geo components work against the default indexed field.

h1. Mapping Options

|_. Option |_. Description |
|@lat_lon@|Set to @true@ to also index the @.lat@ and @.lon@ as fields. Defaults to @false@.|
|@geohash@|Set to @true@ to also index the @.geohash@ as a field. Defaults to @false@.|
|@geohash_precision@|Sets the geohash precision, defaults to 12.|

h1. Usage in Scripts

p. When using @doc[geo_field_name]@ (in the above mapping, @doc['location']@), the @doc[...].value@ returns a @GeoPoint@, which then allows access to @lat@ and @lon@ (for example, @doc[...].value.lat@). For performance, it is better to access the @lat@ and @lon@ directly using @doc[...].latValue@ and @doc[...].lonValue@.
