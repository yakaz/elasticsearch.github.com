title: Keyword Repeat Token Filter

p. The @keyword_repeat@ token filter Emits each incoming token twice once as keyword and once as a non-keyword to allow an un-stemmed version of a term to be indexed side by site to the stemmed version of the term. Given the nature of this filter each token that isn't transformed by a subsequent stemmer will be indexed twice. Therefore, consider adding a @unique@ filter with @only_on_same_position@ set to @true@ to drop unnecessary duplicates. 

p. Note: this is available from @0.90.0.Beta2@ on. 

p. Here is an example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
index :
    analysis :
        analyzer :·
            myAnalyzer :
                type : custom
                tokenizer : standard
                filter : [lowercase, keyword_repeat, porterStem, unique_stem]    
            unique_stem:
                type: unique
                only_on_same_position : true
