h2. Upgrade Notes:
 * Upgrading from 0.18 requires issuing a full flush of all the indices in the cluster (@curl host:9200/_flush@) before shutting down the cluster, with no indexing operations happening after the flush.
 * The local gateway state structure has changed, a backup of the state files is created when upgrading, they can then be used to downgrade back to 0.18. Don't downgrade without using them.

h2. New features:
 * Upgrade to Lucene 3.6 ("#1862":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1862)


h2. Enhancements:
 * Upgrade to Netty 3.4.1 ("#1863":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1863)
 * Better handling of fields that have @.@ in their name when doing property based navigation ("#1875":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1875)
 * Upgrade to Netty 3.4.1.Final ("#1878":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1878)
 * Bulk API: Allow to control if its compressed or not using @action.bulk.compress@ (defaults to true which is current behavior) ("#1850":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1850)
 * Date Histogram Facet: Add @quarter@ as an interval  ("#1884":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1884)
 * Node Stats: Add timestamp per node stats element ("#1851":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1851)


h2. Bug fixes:
 * Relocation of shards causes bulk indexing client to hang ("#1839":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1839)
 * Setting index.auto_expand_replicas in the elasticsearch config file does not apply ("#1852":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1852)
 * XContentBuilder throws NPE on null Boolean ("#1853":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1853)
 * On recovery (startup), the recovery translog file handle is not properly closed ("#1866":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1866)
 * NullPointerException in geo_distance_range without to ("#1865":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1865)
 * JDK 7 requires minimum of 256k stack size, update scripts to set it ("#1892":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1892)
 * When a node disconnects from the cluster (not enough master nodes, or a client node) and rejoins it might not update its internal routing table ("#1896":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1896)
 * Highlighting: Using "plain" (non term vector) highlighting with custom score within a filtered query fails to highlight ("#1894":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1894)
 * Translog: Buffering translog does not write directly to the file channel but to RAF, which causes problems reading from the channel on windows ("#1887":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1887)
