h2. Upgrade Notes

p. In order to upgrade to this version, and full cluster restart is required. Shutdown the cluster using the cluster wide shutdown API, upgrade the version, and start it back up.

p. The new versioning feature will only start to kick in for newly indexed docs.

h2. Breaking changes:
 * -Des.config=/path/to/config/file doesn't replace $ES_HOME/elasticsearch.conf, just appends to it ("#588":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/588)
