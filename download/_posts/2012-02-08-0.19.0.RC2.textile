h2. Upgrade Notes:
 * Upgrading from 0.18 requires issuing a full flush of all the indices in the cluster (@curl host:9200/_flush@).
 * The local gateway state structure has changed, a backup of the state files is created when upgrading, they can then be used to downgrade back to 0.18. Don't downgrade without using them.

h2. Enhancements:
 * Avoid placing a shard replica on the same machine as shard itself ("#1680":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1680)
 * GC logging: Enable back automatic gc logging based on thresholds (even if last gc is not available) ("#1679":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1679)
 * Index API: Don't wait for new mappings to be applied on the cluster by default ("#1677":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1677)
 * Nodes Info API: Add @all@ flag to return all data ("#1676":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1676)


h2. Bug fixes:
 * Transport buffer overrun can happen because of byte buffer reading optimization introduced in 0.19.0.RC1 ("#1686":http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/issue/1686)
